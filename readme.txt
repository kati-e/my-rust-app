Hi there, this is my first attempt at Rust.
Is a little crab holding a weather forecast console app.

To play, type in the terminal: 'cargo run {city} {country_code} (Example: 'cargo run Brisbane AU')
**NOTE: You will need your own API key from OpenWeather -- they are free so go grab one ^^

To Dos:
- I need to handle the errors by calling the 'sad_crab' function when data is not received. Right now, it just shows the error.
